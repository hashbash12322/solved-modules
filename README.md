The objective of this problem is to ensure that students understand the concept of Object-oriented programming (OOP). In this case it’s tested with the understanding of objects and encapsulations.Problem DescriptionIn this problem, you are required to create 3 classes:The valid operations are:1. MODULE &lt;CODE&gt; &lt;LECTURE SCHEDULE&gt; &lt;TUTORIAL SCHEDULE&gt; &lt;LAB SCHEDULE&gt;– This operation adds the module with code = &lt;CODE&gt; to the student’s timetable if all the schedules of this modules (lecture, tutorial and lab schedule) do not clash with the schedules of all the modules in current timetable.– Output “Added” if the module can be added to the student’s timetable.– Otherwise output “Clashed”.2. COUNT &lt;DAY&gt;– This operation counts the number of classes/schedules (not module) that the student has on &lt;DAY&gt;.– Output the number of classes that the student has on &lt;DAY&gt;.* Condition for no clash between Person1 and Person2 is given as:Person2.startTime &gt;= Person1.endTime OR Person1.startTime &gt;= Person2.endTimeInputThe first line of the input contains an integer K (1 &lt;= K &lt;= 30), denoting the number of operations given. The next K lines are the operations.OutputThere are K lines in the output. Output in line-i is the result of query-i.Sample Input10MODULE CS1020 Wednesday 10 12 Tuesday 9 10 Thursday 10 12MODULE CS1010 Wednesday 8 10 Tuesday 8 9 Thursday 9 10MODULE CS2103 Wednesday 8 10 Wednesday 10 12 Wednesday 12 13MODULE CS2100 Monday 10 12 Wednesday 9 10 Friday 10 12COUNT WednesdayMODULE CS1231 Friday 8 10 Friday 12 14 Friday 14 15MODULE CS2105 Friday 15 16 Tuesday 16 18 Tuesday 15 16MODULE CS2102 Friday 10 14 Monday 16 18 Thursday 16 18COUNT FridaySchedule– day : String– startTime : Integer– endTime : IntegerTimetable– listOfModules : ListModule– code : String– lectureSchedule : Schedule– tutorialSchedule : Schedule– labSchedule : ScheduleCOUNT SundaySample OutputAddedAddedClashedClashed2AddedAddedClashed40ExplanationQuery 1: The student can add module CS1020 to his timetable.Query 2: The student can add module CS1010 to his timetable.Query 3: CS2103 lecture schedule will clash with CS1010 lecture schedule, hence the student cannot add CS2103 to his timetable.Query 4: CS2100 tutorial schedule will clash with CS1010 lecture schedule, hence the student cannot add CS2100 to his timetable.Query 5: There are 2 classes to be attended on Wednesday. They are CS1020 and CS1010 lecture.Query 6: The student can add module CS1231 to his timetable.Query 7: The student can add module CS2105 to his timetable.Query 8: CS2102 lecture schedule will clash with CS1231 tutorial schedule, hence the student cannot add CS2102 to his timetable.Query 9: There are 4 classes to be attended on Friday. They are CS1231 lecture, CS1231 tutorial, CS1231 lab and CS2105 lecture.Query 10: There is no class to be attended on Sunday.NoteTo make things simpler, the problem should be solved using OOP.Algorithm Template1. How to check whether a schedule clashes with other schedules?2. How to check whether a module clashes with other modules?3. What data structure should be used to store all taken modules?4. How to count the number of schedules attended on a particular day?
